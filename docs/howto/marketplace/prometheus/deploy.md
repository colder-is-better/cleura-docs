# Creating a Prometheus instance

This guide covers the deployment of a self-hosted [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) service.

To proceed, make sure you have an [account in {{brand}}](../../getting-started/create-account.md), and you are logged in to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}).

## Step-by-step deployment

In the left vertical pane of the {{gui}}, expand the *Marketplace* category and click on *Discover Apps and Services*.
In the central pane, you will see all available applications and services.
Locate the *Prometheus* box and click the green *View* button.

You will see the *Prometheus* information page, where you can learn more about its features, and obtain pricing information.
Click the orange *Deploy this App* button to start the deployment process.

The Prometheus application is hosted on a [Nova VM](../../openstack/nova/new-server.md), so now you may select a region, a name, a flavor, a public network, a keypair, and a security group for it.
Regarding the security group, [make sure it includes a rule](../../openstack/neutron/create-security-groups.md) allowing incoming TCP connections to port 9090.

The deployment takes some minutes to complete.
To check how it is going, expand the *Marketplace* category in the vertical pane on the left and click *Provisioned Apps*.
In the central pane, watch the Prometheus Heat stack row.
The animated icon at the left marks the deployment progress.

You need your deployment's URL.
For that, make sure you are in the *Provisioned Apps* pane.
Click on the Prometheus row to expand it, and select the *Stack Output* tab.

We recommend you start with the official [Getting Started](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/) page to learn how to use your new monitoring service.
