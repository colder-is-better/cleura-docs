# Creating a Grafana instance

This guide covers the deployment of a self-hosted [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) service.

To proceed, make sure you have an [account in {{brand}}](../../getting-started/create-account.md), and you are logged in to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}).

## Step-by-step deployment

In the left vertical pane of the {{gui}}, expand the *Marketplace* category and click on *Discover Apps and Services*.
In the central pane, you will see all available applications and services.
Locate the *Grafana* box and click the green *View* button.

You will see the *Grafana* information page, where you can learn more about its features, and obtain pricing information.
Click the orange *Deploy this App* button to start the deployment process.

The Grafana application is hosted on a [Nova VM](../../openstack/nova/new-server.md), so now you may select a region, a name, a flavor, a public network, a keypair, and a security group for it.
Regarding the security group, [make sure it includes a rule](../../openstack/neutron/create-security-groups.md) allowing incoming TCP connections to port 3000.

The deployment takes some minutes to complete.
To check how it is going, expand the Marketplace category in the vertical pane on the left and click *Provisioned Apps*.
In the central pane, watch the Grafana Heat stack row.
The animated icon at the left marks the deployment progress.

## Logging into the Grafana dashboard

You need the administrator's predefined username and password, as well as the URL of your Grafana instance.
For that, make sure you are in the *Provisioned Apps* pane.
Click on the Grafana row to expand it, and select the *Stack Output* tab.

We recommend you create a new entry in your password manager, and populate all necessary fields with values from the corresponding output keys.

For the preset password, click the icon in the *Action* column of the *admin_password* row.
A pop-up window appears.
Click the blue *Copy Output!* button to copy the password into the clipboard.
When ready, click the *Back* button to close the window.
